# respiratory-complex-I

Bash scripts for calculating the reduction potential (E0) of respiratory complex I.

* DGout_calculator.sh reads the solvation free energy from APBS and outputs the DGout and E0.

* E0_calculator.sh reads the solvation free energy from APBS and outputs the E0 profile.

* aNQ2_calculator.sh reads the solvation free energy from APBS and outputs the E0 as function of salt concentration for a[2Fe-2S] in the Nqo2 subunit.

* apbs_pdb_builder_iso.sh builds PDBs of the isolated subunit for continuum electrostatic energy calculations using the APBS program.

* apbs_pdb_builder_peri.sh builds PDBs of the peripheral domain for continuum electrostatic energy calculations using the APBS program.
