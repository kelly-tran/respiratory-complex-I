# respiratory-complex-I

Bash scripts for calculating the reduction potential of respiratory complex I.

* apbs_pdb_builder.sh builds PDBs for continuum electrostatic energy calculations using the APBS program.

* DGout_calculator.sh reads in the solvation free energy from APBS and outputs the DGout and reduction potential (E0).

* E0_calculator.sh reads in the solvation free energy from APBS and outputs the reduction potential (E0) profile.
